    <h3>Brief bio of myself:</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Edward and I'm looking to make a difference in my life. Tired of always thinking it the same shit just a different day.
    I want to change my life in the next 6 months and see where my motivation will take me.
    I know that the next 6 months will be hard but I need to persevere. I tried in the past to take course but looking back ... I was just trying to do what my friends were doing.
    They gave up and so did I. Never bothered to look back unitl rececntly, saw an ad by glassdoor that demonstrated the top 10 IT roles for 2021 with the different kinds of salaries for IT roles.
    I sat there looking for over an hour at all the different requirements for each job and thought this is what I had originally went to school for.
    There was not reason from me to just give up. Money was an issue at the time but I found out that I can get certifications if I finish bootcamps.
    The interent is vast, there are millions of ways to get help. Now is the time to get started ... again haha. I have alot of time on my hands and will plan to study a few hours each day, minimum of one hour each day.
    Maybe blog about it or just record the videos for myself to look back at my progess as time goes on. I won't completely cut off my enjoyments in life like gaming with the boys or spending time with my family.
    Just have to tone it down. I enjoy gaming with the squad (Luis, Jayson, and Angel), we always aruging when things go wrong or hyping each other up when we pull off a near death experience.
    I also enjoy watching the lasted videos from my favorite youtubers like Pestily, Landmark, DeadlySlob, Trick2g, BoxBox, and many others.
    Othing things I like to do include drinking (Trying out new drinks) and eating at different restaurants.
